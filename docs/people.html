<h3>Prof. Nicholas Coops, <em>Project Lead</em></h3>
<p><a href="https://forestry.ubc.ca/faculty-profile/nicholas-coops/">Professor Nicholas Coops</a> holds a Canada Research Chair in Remote Sensing (Tier 1) at UBC. He has published &gt;460 total referenced peer-reviewed journal publications and is internationally recognised as a scientific leader in the field of remote sensing. He was the principal investigator of the AWARE project, a 5-year research project focused on developing LIDAR applications in Canada for forestry applications. He is a co-author on the Canadian Forest Service LIDAR best practice guide series, the most downloaded CFS information handbook ever, focused on LIDAR data processing. In 2020 he was the co-receipt of the Marcus Wallenberg prize for scientific achievements contributing to significantly broadening knowledge and technical development within the field of Forestry.</p>
<p>Coops has lead a previous, successful Forestry Futures Trust Ontario grant investigating the application of SPL data for forest inventory and plot stratification in Ontario.</p>
<div id="responsibilities-ncc" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Responsibilities</h4>
<p>Coops as the PI will manage the budget, an overall assignment of students and researchers to the project. A research scientist (RS) will be based and supervised by Coops at UBC. At the completion of the project the RS at UBC will ensure the software is able to be released openly and publicly to allow other forest management areas in Ontario covered by SPL data to be applied and for use by Provincial staff.</p>

<h3>Grant McCartney, <em>partner</em></h3>
<p><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/grantmccartneygis">Mr. Grant McCartney</a> is a spatial analyst and forest information systems coordinator with Rayonier Advanced Materials (RYAM) Forest Management. He performs spatial analysis in support of forest management planning (FMP) and forestry operations on the Gordon Cosens, Romeo Malette and Martel – Magpie Forests in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. He leads the acquisition of remotely sensed data including Digital Aerial Photogrammetry (DAP) and LiDAR for RYAM. Grant is a member of the Forest Information Data Advisory Group (FIDAG) and Provincial Forest Inventory Advisory Committee (PFIAC) working to improve the quality of spatial forest information in the province. Grant has been an industrial partner in numerous research efforts including: the Assessment of Wood Attributes for REmote sensing (AWARE) project, CWFC – FIP , past FFT - KKTD projects and the recently approved <a href="mailto:Silv@21" class="email">Silv@21</a>.</p>
<div id="responsibilities-gm" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Responsibilities</h4>
<p>We will work with RYAM Forest Management at a number of their forest management areas where FRI data and EFi data exist. McCartney or designate will provide plot data, SPL and any other relevant datasets over the areas to ensure accurate model development. McCartney or designate will also attend project meetings, assess model accuracy with RYAM staff and test developed software as required.</p>
